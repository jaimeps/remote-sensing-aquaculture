### Description
This is a small project using [Google Earth Engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/), a geospatial processing platform that combines a catalog of 30+ years of satellite images and Google's cloud-based computing power.

The goal of this project is to track the spread of shrimp farms in South Vietnam by analyzing and classifying one satellite image every 2 years from 1988 to 2012.
